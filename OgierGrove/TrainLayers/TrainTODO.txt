Train TODO List

--> Core features
1. Physical Layer
2. Data Link Layer
3. Application Layer
	- Train display
	- Train sending commands with routing tables and such

--> "Should Really Be Done"
- Make a new mailbox size, 16 to handle all the train messages (Because they will never be bigger than that)
- Move ISRMessageHandler to ISRLayer
- Physical layer should restart message grabbing if an unescaped 0x02 is read
- Rename UART driver
