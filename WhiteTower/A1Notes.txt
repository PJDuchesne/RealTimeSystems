TODO: Notes for A1

Five Broad Tasks
	1. ISR for UART0
	2. ISR for SysTick
	3. Monitor
	4. Queue Between Monitor and ISRs
	5. "Command Support Routines"


Classes to Make
	- UART Driver
	- SYSTIck Driver
	- Monitor
	- Buffer (Templated for the 3 uses)
	- CommandCenter (Time, Date, Alarm)
	- Time Class (To keep track of time and such)

	TODO: Rename ISRMsgMaker -> ISRMsgHandler (or something)

	TODO: Zoo function

	TODO: 
	- Hook in SYSTick and test TIME
	- Finish CommandCenter's command handling to actually do stuff (i.e. setTime after reading arugments)
