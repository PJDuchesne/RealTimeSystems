Notes for A1

Five Broad Tasks
	1. ISRS (UART0 / SYSTICK)
	3. Monitor
	4. Queue Between Monitor and ISRs
	5. "Command Support Routines"

TODO: 
	- Do a time test!

	Questionable TODO (Or look into):
	- Rewrite ISRMsgHandler to be a separate layer. It's pretty open right now
    - Check if UART was busy when message was found. See datasheet

	Bonus TODO:
	- Add buffer of previous commands
	- VT-100 color options
		- Two commands: Background && Foreground

Test Plan:
	1. Basic Functionality
	2. Time: Formed
	3. Time: Malformed
	4. Date: Formed
	5. Date: Malformed
	6. Alarm: Formed
	7. Alarm: Malformed
	8. Manual Writing Test
	9. VT-100 inputs (Arrow, Function keys, Keypad)
	10. Delete
