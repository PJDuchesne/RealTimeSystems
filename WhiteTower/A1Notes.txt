Notes for A1

Five Broad Tasks
	1. ISRS (UART0 / SYSTICK)
	3. Monitor
	4. Queue Between Monitor and ISRs
	5. "Command Support Routines"


Classes to Make
	- UART Driver
	- SYSTIck Driver
	- Monitor
	- Buffer (Templated for the 3 uses)
	- CommandCenter (Time, Date, Alarm)
	- Time Class (To keep track of time and such)

	TODO: 
	- Zoo Memory issue
	- Update queue to not use booleans (and instead have 1 empty space)
	- Add CONST to most member functions
	- VT-100 stuff
	- Update input to only work with displayable characters (i.e. avoid arrow keys)
	- Rewrite ISRMsgHandler to be a separate layer. It's pretty open right now
	- Fix month array indexing
	- Fix class ordering in cpp files
